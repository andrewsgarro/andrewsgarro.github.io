This is a virtual library interactive website. The website is a reformatting of the information presented by the following New York Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/books/review/paperback-row.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbooks&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=books&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=7&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com

I have written this site using HTML, CSS and JQuery. The website features a carousel slider that scrolls through 7 books. Clicking each book cover opens a short paragraph review, a link to a longer review on the New York Times website, and a link to the book's amazon page. Clicking on each author photo opens a short "about the author" blurb.
